        <h1>Chris Policheri</h1>
        <p><strong>Artist, Gamer, Collector, AFOL,</strong><em> and a Fanatic of Pop Culture</em></p>
        <p>I am an artist of all sorts, a painter,<em> (mostly acylic)</em> a photographer, <em>(mostly toys)</em> a craftsman, and a storyteller through film & animation.
          <br />I love gaming and although XBox had my heart for over 13 years, the last 5 have been pretty much Playstation. <em>Nintendo and Retro games are always fun as hell!</em>
          <br />I've worked a number of jobs from promotional marketing to selling clothes but mostly in hospitality and restaurants... Well until recently
